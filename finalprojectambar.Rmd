## **Introduction**
[Link to Airline Reviews and ratings](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anandshaw2001/airlines-reviews-and-rating)

Hate not having a knowledge how you're flight never has any info to help you make a decision base on you and your budget, wish it was much simpler to decided if you want a late flight vs a morning flight and if it is worth it? In our presentation we are trying to show the difference between business class, economy class, and premium economy class.By the rating, reviews, and also the experience of the flights.The data I have chosen "Airlines Reviews and rating" from Kaggle and the data created by Anandshaw.

##
Which airline has the best customer service?

```{r}
best_customer_service <- airline %>%
  group_by(Country) %>%
  summarize(averagecustomerservice = mean(Cabin.Staff.Service, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(averagecustomerservice))

best_customer_service %>% knitr::kable()

```
##

How many Planes are Boeing planes?

```{r}
boeing_planes <- airline %>%
  filter(str_detect(Aircraft.Type, "Boeing"))

n_boeing_planes <- nrow(boeing_planes)

n_boeing_planes

```

##
Does business class have better accommodation compare to economy? 
```{r}
# Filter data for business class
business_class <- airline %>%
  filter(Seat_Types == "Business Class")

# Filter data for economy class
economy_class <- airline %>%
  filter(Seat_Types == "Economy Class")

# Calculate average ratings for each amenity in business class
avg_ratings_business <- business_class %>%
  summarize(avg_seat_comfort = mean(Seat.Comfort, na.rm = TRUE),
            avg_cabin_staff_service = mean(Cabin.Staff.Service, na.rm = TRUE),
            avg_ground_service = mean(Ground.Service, na.rm = TRUE),
            avg_food_beverages = mean(Food...Beverages, na.rm = TRUE))

# Calculate average ratings for each amenity in economy class
avg_ratings_economy <- economy_class %>%
  summarize(avg_seat_comfort = mean(Seat.Comfort, na.rm = TRUE),
            avg_cabin_staff_service = mean(Cabin.Staff.Service, na.rm = TRUE),
            avg_ground_service = mean(Ground.Service, na.rm = TRUE),
            avg_food_beverages = mean(Food...Beverages, na.rm = TRUE))

# Print the results
avg_ratings_business
avg_ratings_economy

```

##
What is the difference between Economy and Buiness class ex:food bev, wifi, inflight entertainment ect.

```{r}

# amenity in business class
avg_ratings_business <- business_class %>%
  summarize(avg_seat_comfort = mean(Seat.Comfort, na.rm = TRUE),
            avg_cabin_staff_service = mean(Cabin.Staff.Service, na.rm = TRUE),
            avg_ground_service = mean(Ground.Service, na.rm = TRUE),
            avg_food_beverages = mean(Food...Beverages, na.rm = TRUE))

#  amenity in economy class
avg_ratings_economy <- economy_class %>%
  summarize(avg_seat_comfort = mean(Seat.Comfort, na.rm = TRUE),
            avg_cabin_staff_service = mean(Cabin.Staff.Service, na.rm = TRUE),
            avg_ground_service = mean(Ground.Service, na.rm = TRUE),
            avg_food_beverages = mean(Food...Beverages, na.rm = TRUE))

differences <- avg_ratings_business - avg_ratings_economy

differences

differences_long <- differences %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "Amenity", values_to = "Difference")


differences_plot <- ggplot(differences_long, aes(x = Amenity, y = Difference, fill = Amenity)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Differences Between Economy and Business Class Amenities",
       x = "Amenity",
       y = "Rating") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")

#plot
print(differences_plot)
```
##
which country has the best flights (examaple)?
