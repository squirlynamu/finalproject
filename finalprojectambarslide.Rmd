## **Introduction**
[Link to Airline Reviews and ratings](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anandshaw2001/airlines-reviews-and-rating)

Hate not having a knowledge how you're flight never has any info to help you make a decision base on you and your budget, wish it was much simpler to decided if you want a late flight vs a morning flight and if it is worth it? In our presentation we are trying to show the difference between business class, economy class, and premium economy class.By the rating, reviews, and also the experience of the flights.The data I have chosen "Airlines Reviews and rating" from Kaggle and the data created by Anandshaw.

## **Questions**


1. Which airline has the best customer service?

2. How many Planes are Boeing planes? and what percentage are they to the flights?

3. Who has better cabin crew, and ground service business class, economy,premium economy, or first
   class?

4. What is the difference between Economy, Business class, Premium Economy, and First Class for food &    beverage, WiFi, in flight entertainment?

5. Which top 20 flights have the best value for your money?

6. What percentage of flights are recommended? 

7. Which travelers had the best value for their money? 

8. where did the most of Solo Leisure, Couple Leisure, Business, and family leisure travel?

**1. Which airline has the best customer service?**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
best_customer_service <- airline %>%
  filter(!is.na(Cabin.Staff.Service)) %>%
  group_by(Country) %>%
  summarize(averagecustomerservice = mean(Cabin.Staff.Service)) %>%
  arrange(desc(averagecustomerservice))

ggplot(best_customer_service, aes(x = reorder(Country, -averagecustomerservice), y = averagecustomerservice)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue") +
  labs(title = "Average Customer Service Rating by Country",
       x = "Country",
       y = "Average Customer Service Rating") +

**2. How many Planes are Boeing planes? and what percentage are they to the flights?**

```{r,echo=FALSE }

boeing_planes <- airline %>%
  filter(str_detect(Aircraft.Type, "Boeing"))

n_boeing_planes <- nrow(boeing_planes)

total_flights <- 3290  

percentage_boeing_planes <- (n_boeing_planes / total_flights) * 100

pie_data <- data.frame(Category = c("Boeing Planes", "Other Planes"),
                       Percentage = c(percentage_boeing_planes, 100 - percentage_boeing_planes))

                       "\nOther Planes: ", round(100 - percentage_boeing_planes, 2), "%")) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

#I know you dont like pie chart but i still have it for the laughs


bar_chart <- ggplot(pie_data, aes(x = Category, y = Percentage, fill = Category)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(Percentage, 2), "%")), vjust = -0.5) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Boeing Planes" = "red", "Other Planes" = "blue")) +

       x = NULL,
       y = "Percentage",
       fill = "Category",
       caption = paste0("Boeing Planes: ", round(percentage_boeing_planes, 2), "%",
                       "\nOther Planes: ", round(100 - percentage_boeing_planes, 2), "%")) +

**Summary**

Bulgaria, Chile, Costa Rica, Luxembourg, Panama, Senegal, Ukraine, and Brazil have good customer service, and chances are you aren't flying on a Boeing plane. First class is better, but upgrading from Premium Economy is worth it for better service. Unfortunately, the best value for your money isn't always in the place with great customer service, so it may not be recommended that you fly there. However, if you have a family, you probably travel just as much as couples, and most people tend to go to Cape Town for a couples' getaway.
